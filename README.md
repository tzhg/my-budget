# Budget visualiser

This is a simple tool for visualising household financial data.
A demo, using simulated data, is available [here](https://tzhg.github.io/cash-flower).

I designed this tool for my own purposes,
to help me record, evaluate, and plan my expenses and investment decisions.
However, I hope that it may be helpful or inspiring to others.

Shows:
- Cash and savings.
- Income, expenses, and investment profit/loss.
- Breakdown of expenses.

Features:
- Can record appreciation and depreciation of assets.
- Can check for any discrepancy with current cash reserves.
- Calculates capital gains and losses first in first out.

More information is given in the `read-me.txt` file.
